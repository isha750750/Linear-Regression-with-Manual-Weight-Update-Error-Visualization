# Linear-Regression-with-Manual-Weight-Update-Error-Visualization
This project builds a linear regression model from scratch using NumPy. It predicts output (y) from two inputs (x1, x2) by simulating gradient descent with random weights. It includes forward/backward propagation and error visualization over 20 epochs.
